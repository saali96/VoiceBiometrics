This program allows users to store and manipulate audio files in a database. Features include the ability to insert, read, check matching, print, delete, and check the shape of the file. The program also includes functionality to store and check matching for new voices recorded live through the microphone. In addition, the program includes a user authentication feature that utilizes voice recognition and fuzzy logic. Users are prompted to record a voice sample and read out certain keywords. The recorded audio is then uploaded to Google Speech-to-Text and the returned result is compared to the accepted string using fuzzy logic to generate a score. This score is used to authenticate the user based on a threshold.


Users can select from the following options:

1-Insert voices in the file
2-Read voices from the file
3-Check matching with other voices by inputting a new voice
4-Print the file
5-Delete a voice from the database
6-Check the shape of the file
7-Store a new voice to the database live (through the microphone)
8-Check the best matching voice by inputting a live new voice (through the microphone)


This program is useful for anyone who needs to manage a database of audio files and perform various operations on them, as well as anyone who needs to authenticate users using voice recognition and fuzzy logic.
